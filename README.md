# Work in progress

At the moment library provides some basic functionality and can be used with
caution. Breaking changes are expected with every release at this stage.

Huge thanks to @Mossop for all his contributions.

My goal (not sure, when I would be able to achieve it, or even if I'll achieve it) is to create an API, similar to
[python-plexapi](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi). Actually, my final goal is to rewrite my
[plexiglas](https://github.com/andrey-yantsen/plexiglas) project into Rust from Python :) And to "simplify" the task
I've decided to have a separate project with the API.

Any help is welcome. And just in case: I'm far from being an expert in Rust, so if you know how to do things in proper,
Rust-way — feel free to create an issue (or, better, pull-request) to correct the code.

# Supported plex versions

The codebase is regularly tested against three different PMS versions. The
exact list of the releases is generated automatically on a daily basis, to keep
up with all the recent PMS versions. We take every other minor release from
the latest 5 minor releases. At the moment the following versions are
tested:

<!-- plex releases list start -->
