# Work in progress

Sorry, if you're looking for a ready-to-use API, it's definitely not this one.

My goal (not sure, when I would be able to achieve it, or even if I'll achieve it) is to create an API, similar to
[python-plexapi](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi). Actually, to be honest, my final goal is to rewrite my
[plexiglas](https://github.com/andrey-yantsen/plexiglas) project into Rust from Python :) And to "simplify" the task
I've decided to have a separate project with the API.

Any help is welcome. And just in case: I'm far from being an expert in Rust, so if you know how to do things in proper,
Rust-way â€” feel free to create an issue (or, better, pull-request) to correct the code.

As the starting point I'd like to have an easy way to bootstrap test env. You can check out what I've done for
[python-plexapi](https://github.com/pkkid/python-plexapi/blob/master/tools/plex-bootstraptest.py) in terms
of the env: there is a script which creates a new Plex Server instance in docker and populates the library with some
stub media, and assigns this shiny new server to MyPlex account, if required.

# Supported plex versions

The codebase is regularly tested against three different PMS versions. The
exact list of the releases is generated automatically on a daily basis, to keep
up with all the recent PMS versions. We take every other minor release from
the latest 5 minor releases. At the moment the following versions are
tested:

<!-- plex releases list start -->
* 1.30.1.6562-915986d62
* 1.28.2.6151-914ddd2b3
* 1.26.2.5797-5bd057d2b
<!-- plex releases list end -->
